Client output if client receives file correctly:
	"Time taken to tranfer 2s, 40123us
	File successfully received"

Client output if server times out/disconnects:
	"Client timed out too many times waiting on server to respond."

Server output if server sends file correctly:
	"File sent successfully"

Server output if client disconnects/times out during tranfers:
	"Client timed-out during file transfer"

In debug mode:
	Each will print out relevant information such as what seq_num they're currently
	waiting on, if they have to re-send a packet, if they didn't receive any data, 
	etc etc.

	Sample debug output from server:
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending next packet
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous packet
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous packet
		Packet lost!
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending next packet
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 1. Resending previous packet
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending next packet
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous packet
		Packet lost!
		Nothing to read. Resending packet. Try 0
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous packet
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending next packet

	Sample debug output from client:
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 1. Resending previous ACK
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending ACK
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending ACK
		Nothing to read. Resending packet. Try 0
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 1. Resending previous ACK
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending ACK
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 0. Resending previous ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 1. Resending previous ACK
		Packet lost!
		Seq 1, received. Looking for 1. Sending ACK
		Seq 0, received. Looking for 0. Sending ACK
